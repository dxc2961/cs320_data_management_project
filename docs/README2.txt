OPERATING THE APPLICATION

After starting the application, you will be prompted to chose one of the five user
interfaces to log into. The five interfaces are customer (c), shipping employee (s), database administrator (a),
and analysts (y). Each interface is described below. Once you select the interface you wish to use,
you will be prompted to enter your user email, and then your password.

    Customer: This interface is intended for customers to view and edit their information. This includes profile
        information, order information, address information, and payment method information.

    Shipping Employee: This interface is for shipping employees to view and edit certain information regarding
        orders and packages. The employee can search for orders using an order id to get order information and
        they can search for packages using either a package id or an order id to get package information. Searching
        for a package using an order id provides the employee with package information for each package in the
        order.

    Database Administrator: This interface is for SQL experts who wish to manipulate the underlying database itself.
        The administrator can either craft their own SQL scripts or they can launch a new application instance of
        one of the other interfaces.

    Analyst: This interface is intended for analysts who wish to get statistics about the data in the database.
        The analyst can find statistics about packages, like how many of each package type is in the database and how
        many packages of each delivery speed there are.  The analyst can also find statistics about addresses like how
        many are in each country code, state, zip code, and city. Lastly, the analyst can find statistics about payment
        methods like which states the payment methods are from and how frequently each payment method is used.
